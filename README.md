# Word-Guess-Game
A game based in JavaScript that requires one to guess words.
This game allows the user to guess the letters of words that generated by the program.
If the user selects a letter that is not in the word it goes in the "wrong letters bucket".
If the user selects all the letters in the word before the guesses remaining bucket hits 0, then the user wins.
Whether the user wins or loses, at the end of the game the user will have the option to select "y" to restart the game with a new word.
Have fun!
